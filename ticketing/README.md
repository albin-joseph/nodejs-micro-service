# Overview

In this we focusing creating a micro service project resolve all the pain points we faced in blog projects.

**These are the solutions:**
- Build a centrial library as an NPM module to share code between our different projects.
- precisely define all of our events in this shared library
- Write everything in Typescript
- Write test for much as possible/reasonable
- Run a k8s cluster in the cloud and develop on it almost as quickly as local
- Introduce a lot of code to handle concurrency issues
